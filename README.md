# About me
- My name is Evgeny Frolov.
- I learned at Kemerovo State University at the Mathematics faculty.
- I worked as a system administrator and as a software developer.
- I am interested in IT in general and in DevOps in particular. I like that DevOps profession is a combination of programming and system administration professions.
